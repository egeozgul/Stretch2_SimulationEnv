# Stretch2_SimulationEnv

# Instructions

conda env create -f environment.yml          //use this when creating the env for the first time

conda env update -f environment.yml --prune  //use this when pulling updated env from github

conda activate simenv

Python3 test.py




# Goal
Create a simluation environment , and simulate a Stretch 2 robot in the environment.

# TODO
Create conda yaml file for dependencies

Use Pybullet or something similar.

Lets try to use Ros2 if possible

We need to get the wheeles rotating , and all other actuators moving.

if we have time, we can put tables and ingredients in the simulation.
