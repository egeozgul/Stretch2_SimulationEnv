# Stretch2_SimulationEnv

# Goal
Create a simluation environment , and simulate a Stretch 2 robot in the environment.

# TODO
Create conda yaml file for dependencies
Use Pybullet or something similar.
Lets try to use Ros2 if possible
We need to get the wheeles rotating , and all other actuators moving.
if we have time, we can put tables and ingredients in the simulation.
